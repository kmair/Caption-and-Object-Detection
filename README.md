# Caption-and-Object-Detection
Does Object detection and captioning in tandem

This project combines:

- Object detection: The objects are classified on a video stream and highlighted in the video being played. Check source code [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/18/real-time-object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-opencv/?__s=49gzk51snmgloxi5tiun).
- Video captioning: Evaluating video frames, the model identifies the best caption based on a model from Flickr8K dataset. The code is inspired from [this post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/).
